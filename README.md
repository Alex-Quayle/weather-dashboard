# weather-dashboard

## Description

This is weather dashboard that retrieves data on the current weather details for a given city, in addition to providing a 5-day forecast. It acheives this by utilising two OpenWeather APIs: the 5 Day/3 Hour Forecast, and the Geocoding API. This was a challenging project but helped further my knowledge on how APIs can be used, and gave me more practice with making use of local storage.
